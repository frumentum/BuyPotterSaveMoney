#' @title enumerate combination
#' @description This function is based on the output of
#' \code{analyseShoppingCart()}. Using the mathematical partition function from
#' the package \code{partitions} every combination is enumerated. Afterwards
#' the combinations are filtered so only combinations are returned which make
#' sense for the practical utilization.
#' @param listFromASC list as it comes from \code{analyseShoppingCart()}
#' @param intermediateSteps logical; if TRUE, additionally a list is returned
#' which contains the intermediate steps. More in details; default is FALSE
#' @details
#' If \code{intermediateSteps} is set to \code{TRUE}, the output of this
#' function will change to a list of length 2. The first element will be the
#' same matrix as it is produced with \code{intermediateSteps == FALSE}. The
#' second element is a list containing the intermediate steps which are done
#' within this function. These steps include:
#' 1. Enumerate every possible partition using
#'    \code{partitions::restrictedparts()}.
#' 2. filter1: Since we have only up to five different items in the shopping
#'    cart and discount is given for the items' dissimilarity, the greatest
#'    'discount set' can only be the number of different items in the shopping
#'    cart.
#' 3. filter2: Accordingly the smallest summand need to be greater or equal to
#'    the 'number of maxima' in our shopping cart. This filter minimizes the
#'    combinations of partitions which can't lead to a discount set later on.
#' Because there are still some combinations of partitions that can't be a
#' discount set, another function is necessary to point only the possible
#' discount sets out.
#' @return
#' Depending on \code{intermediateSteps} a matrix or a list is returned. Matrix
#' represents the combinations which shall be used for calculating the discount.

  ### let's filter
  # No bigger set of combinations is possible than we have different items in
  # the shopping cart. That means that the first summand need to be lower or
  # equal to the number of different items.
  biggestSummandEqualsDifferentItems <- which(
    everyCombination[1,] <= listFromASC$numberOfDifferentItems

  # Filter impossible combinations, eg the combination 3* 1st book, 3*2nd
  # book, 3*3rd book and 1*4th book: 4 discount + 2*3 discount, but not possible
  # is 2*4 discount + 1*2 discount; in other words, the smallest summand need
  # to be greater or equal to the number of maxima we have in our shopping cart.
  ls <- listFromASC # to make name shorter
  smallestSummandEqualsNumberMaxima <- which(
    everyCombination[ls$maxNumberPerItem,] >= ls$numberOfMaxima
  )
  # for us the intersection of those filters is interesting
