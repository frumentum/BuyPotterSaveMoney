#' @title analyse the shopping cart
#' @description This function analyses the content of a online shopping cart. It
#' looks for the following information: How many items are sold in total, how
#' many different items do we have, what's the maximum number of one item and
#' at least how often do we have this 'maximum number of one item' within the
#' shopping cart.
#' @param shoppingCart shopping cart as an data.frame with one row for one item
#' @return It returns a list with four numeric and named values.
#' @examples
#' ```
#' books <- dplyr::tibble(
#'   itemID = 1:5,
#'   name = c(
#'     "Stein der Weisen",
#'     "Kammer des Schreckens",
#'     "Gefangene von Askaban",
#'     "Feuerkelch",
#'     "Orden des PhÃ¶nix"
#'   )
#' )

#' set.seed(1)
#' randomNumbers <- sample(1:10, 5, replace = T)
#' shoppingCart <- dplyr::bind_cols(books, number = randomNumbers)
